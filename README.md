# BuffonsNeedle
A C++ simulation of Buffon's Needle

This was a simulation created to perform Buffon's Needle experiment any number of times 
and furthermore estimate a value for pi.

It was done as part of a computing project as part of a third year course in Theoretical 
Physics at Glasgow University by Neil Warrack.
